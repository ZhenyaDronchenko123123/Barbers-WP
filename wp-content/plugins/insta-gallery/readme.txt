== Description ==

Instagram Feed Gallery is the most  <b>user-friendly Instagram plugin for Wordpress <b>. It was built to simplify the integration, to reduce time to have sites updated and to be on track with social media that shows best growing indicators.

== Formerly Instagram Feed Gallery ==

This plugin was formerly known as "Instagram Feed Gallery". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019 to change the name of the plugin due to use of the "Instagram" as part of the name. We apologize for the problems that could be caused to you, due the downtime.

== Instagram Token setup ==

Instagram Feed plugin offers you a one-click setup. Discarding the requirement to create any app to do this link, like other plugins do. 

All you need is to do is add your credentials, and then select an Instagram @id or #tags pictures, by clicking on the "Add New Account" button and your Instagram access token will be automatically generated and saved.

== Instagram feed gallery Premium ==

Instagram Feed Gallery is a freemium plugin which allows you to include an unlimited number of user accounts and then create a separate feed for each one. 

It also includes two extra layouts and offers a lot of customization options like a â€˜Load Moreâ€™ button, a box mode for the feed with colors and borders, the option to display the user profile avatar image, username and custom description and many more.

####Pro Features:

> * Multiple Instagram User Accounts
